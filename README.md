Low cost development board based on UP5K.
This is an open-source platform based on a low cost FPGA chip from Lattice, aiming to be used in a wide range of signal processing and control applications, both for education and the industry.
This development supports the Open Source toolchain by [Clifford Wolf](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/).

## Getting Started

- If you are starting from scratch, read our [Getting Started Guide](getting_started/gs_apio.pdf) to set up the software to program the FPGA board. Further documentation can be found in the ["getting_started" folder](Documents).
- Example code for the recommended software can be found in the ["examples" folder](getting_started/example).
- You can download the Schematics and board files by going to the ["altium" folder](Altium) in this repository or by visiting our project in [Circuit Maker](https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/Gonzalo-Castelli/FPGA-ITBA), a free PCB design software for the Open Source Hardware community.
- KiCAD version in progress
